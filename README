For real.

What's the difference between WPFolios Two and Three?
So far, these things:
- Responsive
- Webfonts for both body and title text
- Better typography overall
- Styled with Sass
- Uses the Options Framework plugin rather than embedding it in the theme
- No more Thematic, hello Bones!

So, about Bones:
- http://themble.com/bones
- A lightweight WordPress development theme
- Designed by the fantastic Eddie Machado
- Adorable skeleton character
- I FUCKING LOVE IT

WPFolio Three is now truly it's own theme - before I used Thematic, which was fine, but made it very diffcult to really customize templates. 
Gosh, Bones is great.

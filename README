/******************************************************************
Bones
A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme

_______________________________________________________________
HEADS UP!!!
Bones & Bones (Responsive Edition) have been merged.
_______________________________________________________________

Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup.
It's constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a
frequent user. I'm always open to contribution. :)

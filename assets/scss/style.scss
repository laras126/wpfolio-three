/*
BASE (MOBILE) SIZE
These are the mobile styles.
I set a solid foundation (I think) 
so their aren't too many styles 
in the other stylesheets. 

Isn't that kind of like a poem?

// Styles for all devices
@import "base";

/*
LARGER MOBILE DEVICES
-This is for devices like the Galaxy Note or something that's
larger than an iPhone but smaller than a tablet. Let's call them
phablets.
*/

	@import "mobile";

} // end of media query



/*
TABLET & SMALLER LAPTOPS
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and
in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
the resource intensive styles are added, like the grid.
*/

DESKTOP
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and

RETINA (2x RESOLUTION DEVICES)
This applies to the retina iPhone (4s) and iPad (2,3) along with
other displays with a 2x resolution. You can also create a media
query for retina AND a certain size if you want. Go Nuts.

I didn't.

/*
PRINT STYLESHEET
Feel free to customize this. Remember to add things that won't make
sense to print at the bottom. Things like nav, ads, and forms should
be set to display none.

### Features

You may have noticed there are a few versions of WPFolio. 
Well, what's the difference?

So far, these things:

* Responsive!
* Revised Artwork Meta fields
* Easy webfonts options for both body, headings, and title text
* Typography improvements overall
* Sass and the magic that goes with it
* Uses the Options Framework plugin rather than embedding it in the theme
* Built on a heavily modified [Bones](http://themble.com/bones)


Other tools/frameworks I used and referenced:

* [Compass](http://compass-style.org), Sass library
* Susy for grids: http://susy.oddbird.net
* [FitVids](http://fitvidsjs.com) jQuery plugin for responsive video
* Build tools: [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io)

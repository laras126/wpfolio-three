=== IMPORTANT! ===

This version of WPFolio contains a custom post type for Projects.
If you are migrating from an older version of WPFolio, you will need to 
transfer all of your project posts from posts to the Project type.

I recommend this plugin:

=== FEATURES ===

You may have noticed there are a few versions of WPFolio. 
Well, what's the difference?

So far, these things:
- Project custom type
- Taxonomies for People and Places
- Revised Artwork Meta fields
- Mobile first and responsive
- Easy webfonts options for both body, headings, and title text
- Typography improvements overall
- Styled with Sass
- Uses the Options Framework plugin rather than embedding it in the theme
- No more Thematic, hello Bones! (http://themble.com/bones)
- FitVid jQuery plugin for responsive video (http://fitvidsjs.com)

Other tools/frameworks I used and referenced:
- Compass, of course: http://compass-style.org
- Sassaparilla for typography and general stylesheet structure: http://sass.fffunction.co/
- Susy for grids: http://susy.oddbird.net
- Modular scale: https://github.com/Team-Sass/modular-scale



=== TODOS ===
(For the project on Github to help!)
- Hooks for child themes

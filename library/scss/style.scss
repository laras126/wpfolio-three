Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Import all necessary libraries and call in all separate 
media queries. The base mobile goes outside any query
and is called at the beginning, after that we call the 
rest of the styles inside media queries. 

Don't add styles here! Use a child theme.

BASE (MOBILE) SIZE
These are the mobile styles.
I set a solid foundation 
so their aren't too many styles 
in the other stylesheets. 

Isn't that kind of like a poem?

LARGER MOBILE DEVICES
This is for devices like the Galaxy Note or something that's
larger than an iPhone but smaller than a tablet. Let's call them
phablets.

TABLET & SMALLER LAPTOPS
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and
in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
the resource intensive styles are added, like the grid.

PRINT STYLESHEET
Feel free to customize this. Remember to add things that won't make
sense to print at the bottom. Things like nav, ads, and forms should
be set to display none.

What's the difference between WPFolios Two and Three?
So far, these things:
- Responsive
- Webfonts for both body and title text
- Typography overall
- Styled with Sass
- Uses the Options Framework plugin rather than embedding it in the theme
- No more Thematic, hello Bones!

So, about Bones:
- http://themble.com/bones
- A lightweight WordPress development theme
- Createds by Eddie Machado
- Adorable skeleton character

WPFolio Three is now truly it's own theme - before I used Thematic, which was fine, but made it very diffcult to really customize templates. 
Gosh, Bones is great.

Other tools/frameworks I used:
- Compass, of course: http://compass-style.org
- Sassaparilla for typography and general stylesheet structure: http://sass.fffunction.co/
- Susy for grids: http://susy.oddbird.net
- Modular scale: https://github.com/Team-Sass/modular-scale
